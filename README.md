This is a system designed to track and analyze post deflections caused by cardiac tissue contractions. 

It is written entirely in python based [Jupyter Notebooks](https:/jupyter.org/), hosted using [The Littlest JupyterHub](http://tljh.jupyter.org/), and rendered using [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila/).
